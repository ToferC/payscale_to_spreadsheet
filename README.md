# Payscale to Spreadsheet

This respository will take an excel or ODS spreadsheet with rows for:

* Last name
* First name
* Group
* Level
* Step
* Start date
* End date

and will query the [gc-payscales Graphql API](https://gc-payscales.herokuapp.com/) and return the pay for that group, level, step and time period.
